1.18 LAB: Warm up: Hello world
This zyLab activity prepares a student for a full programming assignment. Warm up exercises are typically simpler and worth fewer points than a full programming assignment, and are well-suited for an in-person scheduled lab meeting or as self-practice.

For each of the following steps, end the program's output with a newline.

(1) Write a program that outputs the following. (1 pt)

Hello world!

(2) Update to output the following. (1 pt)

Hello world!
How are you?

(3) Finally, update to output the following. (1 pt)

Hello world!
How are you?
   (I'm fine).
